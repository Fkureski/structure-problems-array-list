### About this project

This repository contains my first hands-on implementation of an ArrayList (similar to `java.util.ArrayList<>`). The original version was created by my teacher, but while studying it, I modified two functions to better understand how it works.  

I've also included a `.excalidraw` file (in Portuguese) that visually explains how the implementation works.
